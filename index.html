	<h1>DWM Patch For Large Screens</h1>

	<p>I love <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a> and the whole suckless philosophy behind it.
	Indeed so much that I never had the need to patch the vanilla dwm much.
	But recently I got myself a large ultrawide tft and I found one behavior annoying:	
	The first client is maximized to fullscreen, which leads to a way too big window for me.
	Besides if I want to maximize it, I can still use the monocle layout.
	The following tiny patch will remove this behavior so even the first window is constrained
	to the defined master area.</p>
